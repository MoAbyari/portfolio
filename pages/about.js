                My enthusiasm for solving real-world problems led me into the electrical engineering and management fields. Having studied and worked in the management field also enabled me to initiate, plan and execute projects as well as manage resources effectively.

                What made me passionate about programming traces back to the time I found myself a music geek. Making a unique sound by creating signals, manipulating and routing modules and gears seems to be comparable to developing a program from scratch; both need creativity and a problem-solving mindset.
